<h1>Accountability</h1>
<p>
    Welcome to Accountability - the platform where you and your friends can support each other in meeting your goals, and hold each other accountable for bettering yourselves!
</p>
<strong>How it works: </strong>
<ul>
    <li>One person should create a group and share the Group ID with your friends</li>
    <li>When you log in to your group for the first time, create a personal account, where you can set your goals and what you want to improve on</li>
    <li>Once you are all set, you will see your as well as your group members' progress in your home page</li>
    <li>Send your friends messages to congratulate them if they are doing well or motivate them if they are slacking</li>
    <li>If you are on track with your goals, you will earn badges!</li>
    <li>If you need more support, Accountability will send you personalized resources & your friends will receive a notification</li>
</ul>
